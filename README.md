# 📊 Sales Dashboard with Excel – Data Analyst Portfolio Project

Welcome to my Sales Dashboard project repository! This project showcases how raw sales data can be transformed into actionable insights using Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes transactions from a US-based company between 2014 and 2017. The final result is an interactive and insightful dashboard that allows users to explore sales performance across states, product categories, and time periods.
